# menu

The menu project is a project that displays a food menu. When the page is loaded we have all the food that is in the menu displayed. Next to the All button we have 4 more buttons: Breakfast, Lunch, Shakes and Dinner.
When the user clicks the Breakfast button is shows all the food that is served for breakfast, when the Lunch button is clicked it displays all the food that is served for lunch, when the Shakes buttons is clicked it shows all the shakes that are available in the menu and when the Dinner button is clicked it shows all the food that is served for dinner.
